# BingoForever

A bingo game built on top of TrackMania Nations Forever.

## To Build

1. Get a C compiler somewhere (GCC is used by default but you can change it manualy in `build.bat`).
2. Get an OpenSSL somewhere and place it into `openssl/` directory inside this repository.
   So that `.a` and `.dll` files are directly inside `openssl/` directory and `.h` files are inside of `openssl/include/` directory.
3. Run `build.bat`.
